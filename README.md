# resume
This project is a fully responsive, professional personal resume website. Built from the ground up using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site serves as a dynamic, interactive portfolio to showcase skills, experience, and projects to potential employers and professional contacts.
The primary goal was to create a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate, and mobile-first platform that demonstrates a strong command of core front-end technologies without relying on any external frameworks like Bootstrap or React.
